# Training Piscine Python for Data Science – 1

## Array

### Summary

This exercise introduces the fundamentals of **arrays**, their **manipulation**, and basic **image processing** using Python. The goal is to build a solid foundation for data science tasks by working with numerical data structures and applying transformations to images.

### Objectives

* Understand what arrays are and how they are used in Python
* Learn basic array manipulations and operations
* Apply array concepts to simple image processing tasks
* Practice writing clean, readable, and modular Python code

### Topics Covered

* Arrays and multidimensional data
* Indexing and slicing
* Basic transformations
* Working with images as numerical arrays

### Repository Structure

```
.
├── load_image.py        # Utility to load images
├── pimp_image.py        # Image manipulation functions
├── README.md            # Project documentation
└── assets/              # Sample images (if applicable)
```

### Requirements

* Python 3
* Allowed libraries according to the exercise rules (e.g. NumPy, if permitted)
* No additional external dependencies unless explicitly authorized


### Learning Outcome

By completing this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience with arrays and understand how they are used in data science workflows, particularly in the context of image data.
